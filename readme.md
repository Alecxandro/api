# MACH ERP API

This API was designed to serve as a boilerplate for my future applications.

Although it doesn't implement dependency injection, my primary focus was to keep the features as dynamic as possible.

Of course, itâ€™s built on top of Express.

The key feature of this API is how it handles routes. Instead of declaring each route (as you can see in countless Node.js-based APIs out there), it wraps all route files in a setup.js file and then bootstraps them in a function that takes app = express() as a parameter.

Enjoy it!
